# Mutation-testing baseline & triage policy

Each `pitest<Suite>` run is finalized by `pitest<Suite>Verify`, which diffs the
run's unkilled mutants (`SURVIVED` and `NO_COVERAGE`) against the accepted
baseline in `<suite>-accepted.csv` and **fails on anything new**. Baseline row
format: `class,method,line,mutator,status`. Full policy — the three legal
outcomes for a new survivor, determinism requirements, targeting rules —
lives in sava-build's `HARDENING.md`.

Never refresh with `-PupdateMutationBaseline` just to make the build pass:
kill the mutant, refactor it out of existence, or record its equivalence
reason below. Line numbers are part of the baseline key, so edits to a
mutated file shift entries — confirm the verify task's paired stale/"new"
rows are the shifted old ones before refreshing.

Both suites were fully triaged 2026-07-22: every remaining key has a reason
below; there is no untriaged debt. The 2026-07-22 passes killed 6 keys (settlement-cache
expiry branch and settler decode path via refactor + tests, the verifier's
overrun-guard removal, the handlers comma-scan arithmetic, and the
authority/source fee-payer fast path — refactored out as fully subsumed by
the per-account scan below it, which returns the same error and payer) — see
`SvmExactVerifierTest`'s corruption tests, `SvmExactSettlerTest`'s malformed
payload tests, and `HandlerUtilTests.parseKeyListIgnoresCommaInEarlierParam`.

Both suites run `STRONGER,EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER` since the scripted
`pitestMutatorTrial` re-measure 2026-07-24 (+57 mutants on x402, +1 on
handlers — all killed by existing tests; the JSON builders and byte-array
slicing are receiver-returning calls the default set cannot express).

## x402 suite (13 keys / 14 rows: 12 survived, 2 no_coverage)

`verify` 93 holds two sibling `ORDER_IF` mutants — one row per sibling since
the 2026-07-24 multiset upgrade. Both twins carry the **same** label
(`# unreachable sub-state`, hand-written 2026-07-24): notes key on row text,
so identical twins must stay identical. A label on only one twin — or two
different labels — collides on reload (the note map is keyed by row text, so
the last line parsed wins and then spreads to both on the next refresh),
which is why the tooling never auto-labels siblings; matching labels are the
only safe hand-edit, and they keep the rows out of the `unlabeled` count.

Context that drives most of the triage, established empirically 2026-07-22
(see the corruption tests in `SvmExactVerifierTest`): `TransactionSkeleton`
resolution is *asymmetric*. An out-of-range **program** index throws
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` inside `parseInstructions` (eagerly caught
by `verify`'s catch → `TRANSACTION_COULD_NOT_BE_DECODED`), while an
out-of-range **account** index resolves silently to a `null` account, and a
corrupted data length yields an overrunning slice without throwing. The
committed `crash_*` corpus inputs pin both lazy shapes.

### `# error funnel` — removal reaches code whose failure maps to the identical response

- `SvmExactVerifier.verify` 45 (`EQUAL_ELSE`): skipping the
  `payload == null || transaction() == null` guard reaches
  `Base64.decode(null)` → NPE → the same `INVALID_PAYLOAD_TRANSACTION`.
- `verify` 83 (both directions) and 84 (`NullReturnVals`, `NO_COVERAGE`):
  the null-program guard. A null program is **unreachable** — the parse
  throws first (above) and the catch returns the same error the guard
  would. The line-84 return is therefore uncoverable in-harness; what would
  make it live is sava-core making program resolution lazy the way account
  resolution is. Retained as defense in depth for exactly that case.
- `verify` 87 (`EQUAL_IF` direction): removing the `account == null` check
  sends the reachable null account into `account.publicKey()` — an NPE
  *inside* the try → caught → the identical decode error.

### `# unreachable sub-state` — unreachable sub-states of live guards

- `verify` 87 (`EQUAL_ELSE` direction): a non-null account with a null
  `publicKey()` never occurs — lazy resolution yields null accounts, never
  null-key accounts. The live direction of this guard is pinned by
  `unresolvableAccountIndexRejected`.
- `verify` 93 (`ORDER_IF` ×2, `ConditionalsBoundary`): the skeleton never
  produces a negative `offset` or `len`, and `offset == 0` is structurally
  impossible (signatures precede the message). The *reachable* failure —
  an overrunning slice — has its guard-removal killed by
  `overrunningDataSliceRejected`.
- `verify` 136 (`EQUAL_IF`): `TransferCheckedIxData.read` returns null only
  for a null/empty array; it is always handed the full transaction bytes.
  The discriminator half of the condition is killed by
  `wrongTransferDiscriminator`.
- `SvmExactSettler.settle` 95 (`EQUAL_IF`): `skeleton.feePayer()` cannot be
  null for a transaction that passed verification (verified transactions
  have a non-empty static account table; probed 2026-07-22 — even a zeroed
  signer-count header still resolves a fee payer). The two live mismatch
  directions are killed by the fee-payer mismatch tests.

### `# brittle coincidence` — killable only through a serialization coincidence

- `verify` `verifyComputeLimit` 197 (`ORDER_IF`): removing `len() < 1`
  makes `discriminatorByte` read the byte adjacent to an empty data slice
  (the next instruction's header). Distinguishing that requires pinning a
  serialization coincidence — the adjacent byte happening to equal the
  discriminator — which is a flaky harness by construction. The guard is
  real defense for the raw `data()[offset()]` read.

### `# reachable-domain identity` — equivalent over the reachable domain

- `verify` `verifyOptionalInstructions` 241 (`MathMutator`): in
  `Math.min(i - 3, unknownReasons.length - 1)`, mutating `length - 1` to
  `length + 1` is identity for the whole reachable domain `i ∈ {3, 4, 5}`
  (rule 1 caps instructions at 6). The `i - 3` → `i + 3` variant is killed
  by `unknownOptionalInstruction`.

### `# defensive re-parse`

- `SvmExactSettler.settle` 89 (`NullReturnVals`, `NO_COVERAGE`): the
  `deserializeSkeleton` catch after a successful verify of the same bytes
  cannot fire today (verify already deserialized them). Uncoverable
  in-harness; would become live if a future verify overload stopped
  parsing. The decode catch *above* verify is the live path, covered by
  `malformedTransactionPayloadDoesNotSubmit` / `nullPayloadDoesNotSubmit`.

## handlers suite (4 keys / 5 rows, all `SURVIVED`, all in `parsePublicKeyParams`)

Line 42 holds two sibling `ConditionalsBoundary` mutants — one row per
sibling since the 2026-07-24 multiset upgrade. Both twins carry the same
`# scan-boundary unreachable` label (hand-written 2026-07-24); see the x402
README's note on why sibling labels must match rather than be left off.

- `# equal-not-identical` — lines 30, 34 (`EmptyObjectReturnVals`): returning a fresh empty list
  instead of the `NO_PARAMS` constant — equal but not identical, and the
  API does not promise identity.
- `# scan-boundary unreachable` — lines 38 and 42 (`ConditionalsBoundary`).
- Line 38 (`ConditionalsBoundary`): `end < 0` → `<= 0` differs only at
  `end == 0`, unreachable — `from` is past `indexOfParam` plus the
  parameter text, so an `&` at index 0 cannot be found at or after it.
- Line 42 (`ConditionalsBoundary`, 2 mutants, 1 key): `nextComma == 0` is
  unreachable (the comma search starts a full key-length past `from`), and
  `nextComma == end` is unreachable (the character at `end` is `&` or the
  string end, never a comma). The scan's arithmetic itself is pinned by
  `parseKeyListIgnoresCommaInEarlierParam`, which killed the line-41
  `MathMutator` this pass.

Shrinking a baseline is always an improvement; growing one requires a
reason here.
