# Mutation-testing baseline & triage policy

Each `pitest<Suite>` run is finalized by `pitest<Suite>Verify`, which diffs the
run's unkilled mutants (`SURVIVED` and `NO_COVERAGE`) against the accepted
baseline in `<suite>-accepted.csv` and **fails on anything new**. Baseline row
format: `class,method,mutator,status`, optionally followed by a `# line N`
tag recording where the mutant was last observed and/or a `# <label>` note
naming the row's acceptance family.

A new unkilled mutant has exactly three legal outcomes:

1. **Kill it** — add or strengthen a test. Prefer asserting the property the
   mutant breaks (position after a skip, exact error context, allocation
   bounds) over restating the implementation.
2. **Refactor** — restructure so the mutant cannot exist.
3. **Accept it knowingly** — re-run with `-PupdateMutationBaseline` and record
   the reason below. Acceptance is for mutants that are *equivalent with
   respect to observable behavior*, not for "hard to test". The refresh seeds
   each new row `# untriaged`; finishing triage means replacing that with a
   short family label whose argument lives in a section below (mentioned there
   as `# <label>` — the verify and debt listing warn on labels with no such
   mention, so a typo can't open a phantom family). Rows accepted before label
   seeding arrived (sava-build 21.5.10) carry no label and print as
   `unlabeled` in the verify's per-label counts — their arguments are complete
   below; label a row with its family when touching it rather than by bulk
   inference.

Line numbers left the baseline key in sava-build 21.5.20 (these files were
migrated with `migrateMutationBaselines` on 2026-08-01, row identities
unchanged), so an unrelated edit to a mutated file churns nothing. What is
left is a `# line N` tag every refresh rewrites, plus a **line-drift
advisory** when a key is unkilled only at lines no tag names — the code an
acceptance argues about moved, or a new mutant landed under an old
acceptance. Re-read the argument below when that fires; the price of the
line-less key is that a same-key swap (one mutant killed, another born at the
same `class,method,mutator,status`) is otherwise invisible. See sava-build's
`HARDENING.md`. The baseline is a **multiset**:
identical rows are sibling mutants of one compound condition (one per
operand or branch direction), so duplicate lines are legal and must never be
hand-deduped.

Incremental analysis (PIT history) is available via arcmutate (free licences
for open source; the build plugin activates it when `arcmutate-licence.txt`
sits at the repo root — see sava-build's `HARDENING.md`). Not adopted here
yet: suite scoping keeps full runs around a minute each. If adopted, the
pre-release gate, baseline refreshes, and convergence runs all take
`-PnoMutationHistory`.

The fuzz seed corpora replay deterministically in the unit suite via the
plugin-generated `<Harness>SeedReplayTest` classes (one per fuzz target), so
newly committed seeds — including promoted fuzz findings — face PIT's mutants
automatically. The suites' `targetTests` include `*SeedReplayTest` so the
replays participate as killers.

## Triaged equivalent mutants (accepted with reasons)

Triaged 2026-07-18 across all three suites; grouped by the principle that
makes them equivalent. The baseline CSVs carry the exact keys.

**Slow-path / alternate-path routing** — both paths are result-identical, the
mutant only changes which one runs (performance/allocation, not behavior):
- `DoubleParser.parse` scan mutants that route more inputs to `slow()`, which
  delegates to `Double.parseDouble` — a bit-exact oracle by construction.
  Empirically confirmed over a ~1M-value deterministic corpus.
- `readInt`/`readLong` fast-vs-slow path selection and re-routing of
  already-terminated digit runs; `BytesJsonIterator.parse` SWAR-word-loop vs
  `parseTail` selection; `CharsJsonIterator.parse`/`parseFieldName` forcing
  `handleEscapes` on escape-free content (content-identical copy);
  `FieldMatcher.match` ascii-check boundary forcing the UTF-8 ground-truth
  path; `JIUtil.escapeQuotes*` prefix-fast-forward skips (the generic scan
  re-finds the same first special char).

**Arithmetic identities**:
- `InvertNegs` on the `MIN_VALUE` overflow checks: `-val == MIN` ⇔
  `val == MIN` in two's complement.
- `DoubleParser` `×10⁰ ≡ ÷10⁰`, Eisel–Lemire vs Clinger agreement at the
  2⁵³−1/2²⁴−1 boundaries, refinement/tie-range guards gated by exactness
  tests, `reduceScale(v, 0)` identity; the escape-parity `Incr` mutants in
  `JIUtil`, label `# escape parity`: every `escapes` counter is consumed only
  via `(escapes & 1) == 0`, and flipping the increment direction maps a run
  of n to −n (scan loops) or 2−n (checked backward counts) — same parity
  either way, so the direction is unobservable.

**Unreachable defense-in-depth** — the guarded state cannot arise because an
earlier limit check already rejected it: slow-path wrapped-accumulator
`== 0` cases in `readIntSlowPath`/`readLongSlowPath`, the `scaleLong`
single-step wrap check, `FieldMatcher.hash` len == 8 word agreement,
capacity-sizing mutants in `FieldMatcher.of` (any power-of-two capacity ≥
field count matches identically).

**Static-initializer table** (`JHex$INIT_DIGITS`): built once per PIT minion
JVM before mutants activate, so table-construction mutants are unkillable by
construction. The per-call `decode` mutants all die.

**NC→SURVIVED traps** — covering the line would convert provably-equivalent
mutants on it into new SURVIVED entries: `DoubleParser` `return slow(...)`
sites whose inputs always throw inside `slow`; `parseFieldEquals` truncation
bail-outs whose slow-path true-return is structurally unreachable. The
`JIUtil.escapeQuotes*` deep-escape branches were deliberately taken out of
this set on 2026-07-26: the backslash-run tests
(`testEscapeQuotes*BackslashRunBeforeQuote`, `...LeadingNewlineOnly`) killed
20 accepted mutants — 11 of the 13 NO_COVERAGE entries plus 9 SURVIVED rows
(util 331→351 of 394 detected) — at the cost of the two remaining
NO_COVERAGE mutants surfacing as stranded `# escape parity` increments.
Public-API branches with no test were worth more than the trap avoided.

**Multibyte scan paths**:
- `containsMultiByteOrEscapePattern`: over-detection mutants only route the
  word loop to the byte-accurate slow path; the under-detection direction is
  harmless because no UTF-8 lead/continuation byte (0x80–0xF4) aliases the
  quote (0x22) or escape (0x5C) bytes the word loop acts on — corroborated
  by the 40-offset content sweeps in `TestMultiByteScanSweep`.
- Skip-path `\u` escape accumulation (`skipPastMultiByteEndQuote` bytes,
  `skipPastEndQuote` chars): the divergent `+ → −` accumulation direction is
  killed by the lone-low-surrogate skips in `TestSkip`
  (`test_skip_surrogate_escapes` — borrow propagates into the classification
  bits, so beware "low bits are harmless" blanket reasoning here). The rest
  of the residue was **sweep-verified 2026-07-21**: both variants
  reimplemented outside the codebase and diffed on observable outcome
  (return position + exception identity, including `reportError`'s embedded
  offset; the position-less "invalid surrogate" and `JHex` messages compare
  on identity alone). Domains: all 65,536 escape values × both surrogate
  states × every truncation point × an invalid digit in every position (both
  sources), and the full 4-byte domain lead `F0`–`F7` × 256³ continuation
  bytes. The killed `<<12`/`<<18` mutants were swept as controls and
  diverge, cross-validating the model.
  - **Verified equivalent, accepted**: `head++ → head--` on the digit-4 read
    (all divergence is post-throw cursor state behind a position-less
    exception); `<<4 → >>4` zeroing (bits 4–7 sit below every
    classification bit); `<<6 → >>6` zeroing and both outer `bc >= 0x10000`
    gate mutants (forced entry and `>` boundary — bits 0–11 and the 0x10000
    corner sit below every plane verdict).
  - **Falsified and killed**: `head++ → head--` on the digit-3 read had been
    accepted as "invisible to a skip"; the sweep found 65,536 observable
    divergences — on documents truncated mid-escape the lagging cursor
    misses the tail check, completes the escape from re-read digits, and
    reports "invalid surrogate" where the real code reports
    "incomplete string, offset: N". Killed on both sources by
    `TestSkip.test_skip_truncated_escape_reports_cut_offset`.
- `parseMultiByteString` grow-check always-grow mutants: allocation-only,
  same family as the sized-array-reader equivalents `TestAllocation` kills —
  the never-grow directions are killed, only always-grow is accepted.
- `escapeJson` / `ensureCapacity` buffer sizing.
  Label: `# allocation routing`, triaged 2026-07-25 with the `char[]` rewrite.
  Four rows, all
  producing byte-identical output because every shortfall is corrected by
  `ensureCapacity` before anything is written:
  - `escapeJson:68` `new char[len + 8 + (len >> 3)]`, two MathMutator siblings.
    Only the *initial* capacity moves; a smaller one just grows sooner and a
    larger one wastes a little. The third sibling (`len - 8`) is killed — it
    goes negative on short input and throws.
  - `ensureCapacity:120` `needed <= out.length` → `<`: at exact equality the
    mutant grows a buffer that already fits. Same array contents.
  - `ensureCapacity:123` `out.length << 1` → `>> 1`: `Math.max(needed, half)`
    is then always `needed`, so the buffer is sized exactly instead of doubled —
    correct output, just more frequent growth.
  Deliberately not chased with `TestAllocation`: per AGENTS.md the allocation
  harness is a last resort, and these are precisely the "incidental
  micro-optimization only an allocation bound could observe" case it names as
  accept-worthy. The *observable* directions here are killed —
  `TestJIUtil.testEscapeJsonGrowsPastInitialCapacity` kills both under-request
  mutants on line 77 (`n + span - 6` runs off the end of a 64-control-character
  buffer; `n - span + 6` off a 15-char one where a 13-char span meets the first
  growth point).
- `matchPattern` (the Hacker's Delight zero-byte finder): the three surviving
  MathMutator siblings (`|→&` twice, dropped `~`) each flag a strict superset
  of lanes — verified per-lane over all 256 byte values (no cross-lane
  carries: `(x & 0x7F…) + 0x7F…` cannot carry out of a lane, in the real
  expression or any survivor). The function is shared by the escape/multibyte
  guard *and* the quote matcher, and every word loop checks the guard first,
  so an over-detecting mutant trips
  `containsMultiByteOrEscapePattern` on every word and routes the entire scan
  to the byte-accurate scalar tails before the corrupted quote match can
  fire — result-identical, routing only. Confirmed live (2026-07-23): with
  the `|→&` mutant compiled in, `matchPattern` returns all-lanes-flagged for
  plain ASCII yet the full unit suite and long-ASCII `readString` probes
  produce identical results. The under-detecting siblings (`&→|`, `+→−`)
  corrupt and are killed. Any refactor that gives quote matching its own
  pattern function or reorders the guard voids this argument.

**ASCII word-loop tail handling** (`skipPastEndQuote`, `parseString`,
`parseBase64String` in `BytesJsonIterator`): the divergent directions are
killed by the length sweeps in `TestString`/`TestSkip`
(`*_at_buffer_tail_across_lengths`: forced word-loop entry reads past an
exact-sized buffer; disabled or forced re-align corrupts the post-skip
position, throws on valid input, or spins on the final window until PIT's
timeout). The accepted remainder is equivalent by construction:
- entry `head + 8 > tail` mutants ("true"/boundary): route to the
  byte-accurate scalar/escaped slow path — result-identical, routing only
  (same family as the slow-path routing group above), likewise the forced
  multibyte/escape-detection mutants and `skipPastSingleByteEndQuote`'s
  escape-check mutants.
- re-align `nextOffset > tail` boundary (`>=`): fires one window early, but
  `tail - 8` then equals the offset the cursor already holds — identical.
- final-window `i < tail` boundary (`<=`): at the `i == tail` corner
  (unterminated input, 8-aligned) the mutant re-scans the final
  already-scanned window once, then throws the same incomplete-string error.
- `decodeBase64` trim branch (`limit == length` both directions): the JDK's
  strict decoder sizes its output exactly for every valid input that reaches
  it (invalid input throws first), so the copy is defensive; forcing it is
  allocation-only.

## Timed-out mutants (audited set)

`TIMED_OUT` is detected — these mutants never enter a baseline — but the
watchdog observed slowness, not wrongness: for exactly these mutants the
ratchet cannot see a weakened covering assertion, because a timeout keeps
"detecting" no matter what the test asserts. Per HARDENING.md, the summary's
`N timed out (load-dependent)` is therefore an audited set, not a count: every
member is listed here with the structural cause that makes it spin, and a
mutant timing out that is *not* on this list is something a reviewer stops on.
Members flip `KILLED`↔`TIMED_OUT` run to run — the covering test reaching a
failure races the watchdog over a dead mutant, benign in both directions — so
per-run counts sit at or below the set size. (The 2026-07-21 convergence check
recorded 7 iterator members; one has since settled to `KILLED`.) Membership is
machine-checked: `iterator-timeouts.csv` / `util-timeouts.csv` hold the
`class,method,mutator` keys, and the verify warns on any timeout outside them
(as well as on malformed rows, on a member no mutant matches, on one whose
class and method appear nowhere together below, and — via a machine-local
quiet counter in `.pitest-history/` — on a member with no timeout in 3+
consecutive mutation runs). All of it is advisory by default, re-printed in
the end-of-build summary; `-PstrictTimeoutAudit` escalates the
unaudited-newcomer/malformed/no-set findings to failures on certifying runs,
and the static checks (row shape, cause presence) also run in
`pitest<Suite>Debt`. `numbers` has never timed out, so it has no file and the
check is inert for that suite. The keys are deliberately line-less — drift cannot
churn membership — which is also the check's resolution: a *new* timed-out
mutant inside an already-audited method+mutator matches the existing member
silently. That is why each cause below names the line it argues about; re-read
those lines whenever the code at them changes, because a clean run certifies
"no new method+mutator", not "no new mutant".

As of 2026-07-26 — 8 members, 6 iterator + 2 util, numbers none:

**iterator**
- `BaseJsonIterator.reduceScale:1021`, two mutants (`scale--` → `scale++`;
  loop condition → `true`): the counter crossing the negative `scaleLimit` is
  the loop's only exit; both remove it and the divide loop spins on a settled
  quotient of 0.
- `BaseJsonIterator.skipObject:1122` (scan cursor `i++` → `i--`): the
  `i == tail` bound is an equality a backward walk never meets, and the
  string-skip re-entry (`i = head - 1` after `skipPastEndQuote()`) can pull
  the cursor back into the same cycle indefinitely.
- `BytesJsonIterator.parseMultiByteString:575` (escape-decode `buf[head++]` →
  `buf[head--]`): the cursor backs away from the `head == tail` guard and
  re-decodes earlier bytes; the spin races the eventual bounds fault, which is
  why this member often lands `KILLED` instead.
- `CharsJsonIterator.parse:136` (escape skip `++i` → `--i`): cancels the for
  loop's own `++i`, pinning the cursor on the same backslash — a pure
  oscillation with no exit and no fault.
- `CharsJsonIterator.skipPastEndQuote:156` (`buf[head++]` → `buf[head--]`):
  same reversed-cursor family as `parseMultiByteString:575`.

**util**
- `JIUtil.escapeQuotesChecked:170` (do-while `++from` → `--from`): after an
  odd, already-escaped quote the backward `from` makes `indexOf('"', from)`
  re-find the same quote every pass (a negative fromIndex clamps to 0), so
  the loop never reaches `len`.
- `FieldMatcher.of:51` (`names.length << 2` → `>> 2`): collapses the table
  capacity below the entry count, and the linear-probe insert loop exits only
  on an empty slot or a duplicate name — a full table offers neither.

## Mutator-set trial (2026-07-21)

Per HARDENING.md ("the mutator set bounds what the ratchet can see"),
`EXPERIMENTAL_BIG_INTEGER` was trialed on every suite: `iterator` 1904 → 1904,
`numbers` 326 → 326, `util` 335 → 335 generated mutants — **zero fires**. The
`readBigDecimal`/`readBigInteger` paths construct their results from parsed
chars; no `add`/`multiply`-family arithmetic exists in mutated classes for the
mutator to rewrite. Left off (enabling a mutator that cannot fire is baseline
churn for nothing); re-trial if Big arithmetic is ever introduced.

## Mutator-set trial (2026-07-22)

`EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER` (fluent calls returning their receiver are
expressions, invisible to `VoidMethodCallMutator`), via `pitestMutatorTrial
-PtrialMutators=EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER`: `iterator` 16 generated — 11
killed by existing tests, 5 unkilled; `numbers` and `util` cannot fire (no
receiver-returning calls in their targets). **Enabled on `iterator` only.**
Of the 5 unkilled: 4 were dropped `skip()` calls on the default branches of
`readShortOr`/`readDoubleOr`/`readFloatOr`/`readBooleanOr` — genuinely
untested cursor positions, killed by extending
`TestNull.test_read_primitive_or_default_skips_and_positions` with
position-after reads across all widths (the long/int variants already had
them, which is what killed their mutants in trial); 1 is a `NO_COVERAGE` row
on `JsonIterParserFactory.loadParser`, joining the unreachable-in-harness
ServiceLoader family below.

## Multiset re-triage (2026-07-23)

sava-build 21.5.9's verify compares baselines as multisets, which exposed
sibling survivors the earlier unique-row comparison had collapsed into their
accepted twins — 4 in `iterator`, 14 in `numbers`, 2 in `util`, every one
sharing `class,method,line,mutator,status` with an already-accepted row.
Re-triaged individually:

- **Killed** (real gaps found by the expansion): the lenient-literal-skip
  directions in `BaseJsonIterator.skipTrue`/`skipLiteral` — leniency on the
  `'r'`/`'u'` checks silently *accepted* corrupt documents (`tque`, `trqe`),
  and the truncated-tail `skipLiteral` siblings threw at the wrong offset or
  through `peekChar`'s EOF funnel instead of `expected <literal>` at the
  first divergence. All killed by
  `TestSkip.test_skip_corrupted_literals_reject_at_exact_offset` (every
  corruption position × every literal × fast and truncated paths, exact
  message + offset, all sources); the previously accepted rows at those keys
  died with them and left the baseline.
- **Accepted**: the `matchPattern` over-detection siblings (see the
  multibyte-scan family note above) and the `DoubleParser` /
  `JHex$INIT_DIGITS` sibling occurrences, whose family arguments
  (slow-path routing to the `Double.parseDouble` oracle with the dangerous
  directions observably killed; static-initializer tables built before
  mutants activate) are line-level and cover every operand direction at
  their coordinates. The baselines now carry one row per sibling mutant.

## Unargued NO_COVERAGE pass (2026-08-01)

Seven `iterator` `NO_COVERAGE` rows carried no argument anywhere in this file:
`readNumberOrNumberString` (4), `skipUntil` (2), `closeObj` (1). They were
`unlabeled`, and an unlabeled row is exempt from the family-label mention
warning, so nothing had ever surfaced them — the label state read as "settled
before labels existed" while the argument it pointed at did not exist.

None of them was an equivalence candidate. All three methods are covered
public API whose *branches* were unreached, which is the case the doctrine
calls mechanical work rather than acceptance:

- `readNumberOrNumberString` — every existing caller passed a **quoted**
  number, so only the `STRING` arm ever ran. The bare-number, `null`, and
  wrong-type arms had no coverage at all, which is why `return ""` for
  `readNumberAsString()` and `return ""` in place of `null` were both
  invisible. Killed by
  `TestFloat.test_read_number_or_number_string_across_value_types`, which
  pins all four arms including the error's op and the type it names.
- `skipUntil` — every existing test entered through `{` followed by a field,
  so the two other arms behind that brace never executed: an object that ends
  before any field (`{}` → "not found", not an error) and a brace followed by
  neither a field nor `}` (`{5}` → error, not a quiet "not found"). The two
  answers must not collapse into one. Killed by
  `TestSkip.test_skip_until_opening_brace_arms`, which also swept up the
  line-411 `EQUAL_IF` survivor.
- `closeObj` — the failure path was covered in `TestErrorReporting`; the
  success arm that matches `}` and hands the iterator back for chaining had
  no test, so returning `null` instead was indistinguishable. Killed by
  `TestObject.test_close_obj_returns_the_iterator`.

Result: `iterator` 1776→1787 of 1919 detected, baseline 143→132 rows,
`NO_COVERAGE` rows 21→14. `numbers` and `util` were unaffected (the new tests
are in `Test*` classes all three suites match, but they exercise no code those
suites mutate). Refresh took two passes for a line-less-key reason worth
remembering: `-PpruneMutationBaseline` dropped only 8 of the 11, because the
two dead `skipUntil` line-420 rows share `class,method,mutator` with live
survivors at 397/401 and prune keeps any coordinate still unkilled at another
status. `-PupdateMutationBaseline` on a solo run finished the job after a
per-key diff of report against baseline confirmed the only mismatches were
those 3 rows — no accepted row was missing a counterpart to a timeout, so
there was no flip insurance to lose.

Remaining `NO_COVERAGE` debt, deliberately left for a separate pass: the six
`JsonIterParserFactory` ServiceLoader rows (an *unreachable in-harness* claim,
which sava-build 21.5.20 put an explicit expiry date on) and the twelve
`parseFieldEquals` / `DoubleParser.parse` NC→SURVIVED-trap rows — the same
trap reasoning that was overturned on 2026-07-26 in `util`.

## Convergence check (2026-07-21)

Per HARDENING.md's convergence method: two solo passes per suite and two
`qualityGate` passes, report directories deleted between runs, diffed on
per-mutant status keyed `(class, method, line, mutator)` — **zero differences**
in all nine comparisons (solo-vs-solo, gate-vs-gate, solo-vs-gate, per suite).
The stale-acceptance sweep (each baseline row against the union of unkilled
sets across all four runs) matched **every** row in at least one mode — no row
is widening the gate for nothing. The `TIMED_OUT` rows (7 iterator, 2 util)
were stable in both modes, so the baselines carry no flip-insurance rows to
revisit. The abstract-base `@Execution`/`@TestInstance` instability cannot
apply here: the test suite has no abstract test classes and uses neither
annotation.

**ServiceLoader factory path — unreachable in-harness**
(`JsonIterParserFactory`, 6 NO_COVERAGE — 5 original plus the 2026-07-22
`NakedReceiverMutator` on the `ServiceLoader.load(...).stream()` chain): the
load-success path needs a
registered provider, and the whitebox test setup patches tests *into* the
main module — a provider would need a `provides` directive, which cannot come
from patched-in test sources (the JVM has no `--add-provides`) and does not
belong in the production `module-info`. What would reach it: a blackbox test
suite with its own module descriptor providing a test factory. Covering only
the failure path was considered and rejected — it converts the `loadParser`
return-value mutants into NC→SURVIVED traps (the call throws before either
`return` completes) without observing the load behavior. Accepted as
unreachable in-harness, not as equivalent.

The baseline is otherwise fully triaged; no untriaged debt remains
(the `JsonIterParser` bufSize-shim family closed 2026-07-21 with the shim's
removal — 25.3.0 carried the `forRemoval` marker — and `TestJsonIterParser`
covering the surviving convenience overloads).

Shrinking the baseline is always an improvement; growing it requires a
reason here.
