# Mutation-testing baseline & triage policy

Each `pitest<Suite>` run is finalized by `pitest<Suite>Verify`, which diffs the
run's unkilled mutants (`SURVIVED` and `NO_COVERAGE`) against the accepted
baseline in `<suite>-accepted.csv` and **fails on anything new**. Baseline row
format: `class,method,line,mutator,status`. The full process contract is
sava-build's `HARDENING.md`; `./gradlew qualityGate` runs every suite plus the
unit tests — the pre-release check, run locally before deciding to release
(CI deliberately runs only `check`; it is not a per-commit gate).

A new unkilled mutant has exactly three legal outcomes:

1. **Kill it** — add or strengthen a test. Prefer asserting the property the
   mutant breaks (epoch estimate arithmetic at an explicit `now`, skip-rate
   math, set-cover selection, capped cu price) over restating the
   implementation.
2. **Refactor** — restructure so the mutant cannot exist.
3. **Accept it knowingly** — re-run with `-PupdateMutationBaseline` and record
   the reason below. Acceptance is for mutants that are *equivalent with
   respect to observable behavior*, not for "hard to test".

Line numbers are part of the baseline key, so unrelated edits to a mutated
file can shift entries. Pure line drift — every new row a same-status shift
of a stale one, populations unchanged — passes with a notice; refresh at a
convenient moment (`-PpruneMutationBaseline` is the shrink-only option when
nothing is new). Anything mixed in still fails: triage first, refresh after.

See `../../ravina-core/config/pitest/README.md` for the measured note on
timeout-detected mutants differing between single-suite and multi-suite runs.

## Audited timeout sets (`<suite>-timeouts.csv`)

Per AGENTS.md rule 18, each suite with timeout-detected mutants carries a
membership file the verify audits; a timed-out mutant outside it is a warning
to stop on. Members and their structural causes below — line numbers name the
code each argument is about (the audit key is line-less, so a *new* mutant
inside an already-listed method+mutator draws no warning; re-read the
argument when the named line changes). Seeded 2026-07-27 from a full
`qualityGate` observation that matched the prior run's population exactly.

**catchAll**
- `LookupTableCacheMap.getOrFetchTables:180` `MathMutator` — turns the
  fetch-key cursor's `nextSetBit(i + 1)` into `nextSetBit(i - 1)`, re-finding
  the same set bit forever while `fetchKeys` grows without bound. Detected as
  `MEMORY_ERROR` or `TIMED_OUT` depending on which limit trips first, so it
  only intermittently lands in the timeout column — a status flip between two
  *detected* outcomes, audited so a `-PstrictTimeoutAudit` certifying run
  cannot fail on the coin flip. Same batch-forever family as the
  `refreshStaleAccounts:225` rows below. Expect the quiet-member counter to
  nominate this row for retirement more or less permanently: `MEMORY_ERROR`
  is its common outcome and timing out the rare one, so a quiet listing here
  is the flip showing its usual face, not staleness — re-measure if curious,
  but do not retire the row.
- `LookupTableCacheMap.refreshStaleAccounts:225` `ConditionalsBoundaryMutator`
  and `ORDER_IF` — the batching loop's `from < numStale` exit: the boundary
  flavour admits `from == numStale` (an empty `subList` fetch that advances
  nothing), the removal flavour deletes the exit outright; both batch
  forever.
- `TxCommitmentMonitorService.validateResponseAndAwaitCommitmentViaWebSocket:115`
  `EQUAL_IF` — forces the `txResult == null` route, so a completed result
  still `join()`s a websocket future the scripted fake never completes.
- `TxCommitmentMonitorService.lambda$tryAwaitCommitmentViaWebSocket$1:296`
  `NakedReceiverMutator` — drops `.orTimeout(...)` (a fluent call returning
  its receiver), leaving the finalization future waiting forever (this is the
  1 `TIMED_OUT` the NAKED_RECEIVER trial table records).
- `BaseTxMonitorService.run:67` `EQUAL_IF` — forces the pending-transactions
  poll to read empty, so the monitor loop sleeps forever and never reaches
  the work its test terminates on.
- `TxExpirationMonitorService.lambda$processTransactions$1:83/85` `EQUAL_IF`
  and `NullReturnValsMutator` — both poison the composed
  height-then-statuses poll (83 deletes the empty-batch guard, NPE-ing the
  gate comparison; 85 nulls the lambda's future, NPE-ing `thenCompose`), and
  a failing courteous call is retried forever, so the poison is only
  observable as a timeout.

**epochService**
- `EpochInfoServiceImpl.awaitInitialized:137/141` `VoidMethodCallMutator` —
  one line-less key, two mutants: removing `initializedCondition.await()`
  (line 137) turns the not-initialized wait into a spin that never observes
  the signal, and removing `lock.unlock()` (line 141) leaves the service
  lock held so the next locker deadlocks. Both only observable as timeouts.

## Status

No untriaged debt: every accepted entry has a reason below. `fees` is fully
killed — zero accepted entries.

The `catchAll` suite is the module's safety net — it targets
`software.sava.services.solana.*` and excludes what the focused suites already
own, so a **new class is mutated by default**. It exists because the previous
allowlist targeting silently exempted 31 of the module's 42 classes: all of
`transactions/` bar one, the vendored `helius/` client, the ALT cache, the
websocket manager and the epoch service. Only **2** mutants in those 31 classes
were being killed. Adding the suite surfaced 728 unkilled mutants; 621 are now
killed. If an exclusion goes stale the class is merely mutated twice — slow,
not blind, which is the safe direction to fail.

Five main-source bugs were found while writing these tests, all fixed:
`CachedAddressLookupTable.read` ignoring `offset` when resolving the
deactivation slot (every cached table reported deactivated),
`LookupTableCacheMap.getOrFetchTables` tracking misses in a 32-bit bitset that
wraps past 32 keys (tables silently dropped), `RpcCaller.courteousGet`
discarding its `CallContext` (rate-limit weight silently became 1), and
`TransactionProcessorRecord`'s "missing lookup tables" diagnostic filtering the
complement of what it reported (the message always read `[]`), and
`EpochInfoServiceImpl.run` dereferencing a null `slotStats` — which
`calculateStats` returns whenever every sample is filtered out, notably at the
opening slots of an epoch, so the loop died with an NPE exactly when a new
epoch began. None was found by a mutant *kill* — each surfaced because a test
being written could not assert what the code claimed.

## What PIT's conditional-mutator labels mean here

Settled empirically rather than assumed, by hand-forcing each branch and
running the suite:

- `RemoveConditionalMutator_*_IF` — the condition is forced **true**.
- `RemoveConditionalMutator_*_ELSE` — the condition is forced **false**.

Verified on `PriorityFeeRequest.serializeParams` line 13 (forced true → 5
failures, forced false → 0) and `CachedAddressLookupTable.read` line 38 (forced
true → 6 failures, forced false → 0). Both baselines carry the `_ELSE` row as
`SURVIVED`, which matches. Reasons below are written against this meaning; no
row needs swapping.

Rows labelled `# else-direction-noop` are this shape's family: forcing the
condition **false** converges to the behaviour the tests already pin (the
skipped branch was an optimisation or an early-out whose fallback computes the
same result), while the forced-**true** sibling at the same coordinate is
killed. Sites: `CachedAddressLookupTable.read` line 38 and
`TransactionProcessorRecord.lambda$transactionFactory$3` line 94 (`catchAll`),
`EpochInfoServiceImpl.run` line 248 (`epochService`).

## Mutator set: the experimental BigDecimal/BigInteger trial

`MathMutator` rewrites primitive arithmetic opcodes, so `BigDecimal` and
`BigInteger` math — which is method calls — is invisible to `STRONGER`. This
module has both: fee arithmetic in `SimulationFutures.capCuPrice`, block-height
arithmetic in the tx monitors. Trialled 2026-07-21 per suite, enabling only
what fires:

| Suite | `EXPERIMENTAL_BIG_DECIMAL` | `EXPERIMENTAL_BIG_INTEGER` | Enabled |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fees` | 1 mutant, killed | 0 | `BIG_DECIMAL` |
| `catchAll` | 0 | 3 mutants, all killed | `BIG_INTEGER` |
| `epoch` | — | 2 mutants, all killed (trialled 2026-07-26) | `BIG_INTEGER` |
| others | 0 — confirmed by the 2026-07-26 full trial run | | — |

All six new mutants were killed by tests written under `STRONGER` that had
never seen these operators, so enabling them added coverage without adding a
single accepted entry. Recorded so the omitted mutator in each suite reads as
measured rather than forgotten.

The `epoch` row is a correction: the 2026-07-21 trial recorded "others: no
big-number arithmetic", but `Epoch`'s unsigned block-height delta
(`heightDelta`, `estimatedBlockHeightGivenSlotEstimate`) has been `BigInteger`
`subtract`/`add` all along. The plugin's mutator-blindness scan (sava-build
21.5.14) flagged it on the first `pitestEpoch` run under that version;
`pitestMutatorTrial -PtrialMutators=EXPERIMENTAL_BIG_INTEGER` then fired 2 of
2 killed there and re-confirmed `catchAll`'s 3 and zero everywhere else.

## Mutator set: the `EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER` trial

A fluent call returning its receiver type is an expression, invisible to
`VoidMethodCallMutator` — builder chains, `Duration.truncatedTo`,
`CompletableFuture.orTimeout`. Trialled 2026-07-22 per suite (shared
`HARDENING.md` protocol: enable only what fires, record the numbers):

| Suite | Fired | Outcome | Enabled |
|---|---|---|---|
| `catchAll` | 61 | 56 killed (3 by new tests/seams: the `LoadBalanceUtil` `httpClient` wiring, the `WebSocketManager` factory prototype via a package-private seam), 4 accepted (below), 1 `TIMED_OUT` | yes |
| `epoch` | 9 | all killed — two `logFormat` truncation kills needed non-minute-aligned inputs; the exact-minute test data had made truncation a no-op | yes |
| `fees` | 5 | all killed; the surviving `createTransaction` prepend was a real gap — the existing test never looked at the returned transaction's instructions | yes |
| `config` | 4 | all killed | yes |
| `alt`, `epochService`, `formatting` | 0 | — | no |

## Triaged equivalent mutants (accepted with reasons)

**Logging removals** `# log-removal` — `logger.log(...)` `VoidMethodCallMutator` removals:
log output is not part of any behavioral contract.

**Redundant null-guard assignment** `# null-guard-noop` (`config`, `formatting`) — builder
`parseProperties` guards of the shape `if (x != null) this.field = x;`:
forcing the branch assigns null over an already-null field on a fresh
single-use builder, and `create()` null-coalesces the default either way.
Sites: `EpochServiceConfig$Parser`, `TxMonitorConfig$Parser`,
`TableCacheConfig$Builder`, `HeliusConfig$Parser`, `ChainItemFormatter$Parser`.

**Return-value-only mutation of a delegating predicate** `# delegating-return` (`config`) —
`HeliusConfig$Parser.test` `BooleanTrueReturnValsMutator` on
`return super.test(...)`: the call still executes with its side effects and
its unknown-field throw, and `super.test` only ever returns true.

**Fast path returning the same value** `# same-value-fast-path` (`formatting`) —
`ChainItemFormatter.commaSeparateInteger` `len <= 3` → `len < 3`. Verified by
tracing len == 3: the separation loop writes indices 3, 2, 1 of a 4-char
buffer, exits with `j == 1`, and returns `new String(sep, 1, 3)` — exactly the
input. The guard is an allocation-avoiding shortcut, not a correctness check.
Also verified by differential sweep (2026-07-21): both variants agree on every
input length 0..40 — zero differences.

**Selection-invariant set-cover bookkeeping** `# set-cover-invariant` (`alt`) — `ScoredTable` /
`ScoredTableMeta` `usedMask` mutants (`<<=` → `>>=`, the `(mask & usedMask)`
guard, `usedMask |=` → `&=`) and the `selectedTables` emptiness guard. The
mask only skips re-scoring already-selected tables, whose accounts have
already been removed from `remainingAccounts`; such a table scores 0 and can
never be re-selected, so the selection output is unchanged either way.

**Threshold below the minimum useful score** `# min-score-threshold` (`alt`) — `size() < 2` forced
false: with fewer than 2 remaining accounts no table can score above 1, so the
next round finds no top table and breaks with identical state.

**Duplicated computation** `# duplicated-computation` (`epoch`) — `Epoch.create` line 83 else-branch
recomputes the identical skip rate when `previousSample == earliestSample`
(the `if` is a caching shortcut), and `SlotPerformanceStats.calculateStats`
line 42 routing a single sample through the general path yields the identical
record (middle = 0, min = max = median, stddev 0).

**Whole-collection shortcut over an internal copy** `# whole-collection-shortcut` (`catchAll`) — guards of
the form `to - from == size` that choose between the collection itself and a
`subList`/`copyOfRange` of the whole thing: `LookupTableCacheMap` line 188 and
`BaseBatchInstructionService.batchProcess` line 142. Both branches yield equal
contents, and in each case the array or list is internal, so no caller-visible
reference identity distinguishes them. (The sibling at
`BaseBatchInstructionService` line 93 *is* killed — there a caller-supplied
list makes `assertSame` meaningful.)

**Single-element join is the identity** `# single-join-identity` (`catchAll`) —
`PriorityFeeRequest` lines 13 and 69 `_ELSE`, i.e. forcing the `String.join`
branch: joining a one-element list returns that element, exactly what the
`getFirst()` branch returns. The `_IF` direction is killed.

**Capacity hints** `# capacity-hint` (`catchAll`) — `HeliusJsonRpcClient` line 133
`MathMutator` on the `StringBuilder` pre-size expression, and the
`LookupTableCacheMap` empty-list guard at line 126: allocation shape only,
identical output.

**Both branches build the same record** `# same-record-branches` (`catchAll`) —
`BaseInstructionService.processInstructions` line 257: forcing the error branch
with a null error calls `createResult(..., null, sig, formattedSig)`, which is
the record the else branch already produces. Only the log line differs.

**Running-minimum boundaries** `# running-minimum` (`catchAll`) — `<` → `<=` on a running minimum
(`BaseTxMonitorService.completeFutures` 196/203, `processTransactions` 177/188,
`TxExpirationMonitorService.processTransactions` 68, the earliest-gate scan):
the equal case reassigns the value already held.

**Restating the builder default** `# restating-default` (`catchAll`) — `NakedReceiverMutator` on
`WebSocketManager.createManager` line 39, `.commitment(Commitment.CONFIRMED)`.
`SolanaRpcWebsocketBuilder` initialises its commitment field to `CONFIRMED`,
so dropping the call leaves the identical prototype state — verified against
the builder's getter, which the factory test now asserts. The explicit call
stays because the default lives in another repo and is not a contract.

## Uncovered by testing convention (accepted, and *not* an equivalence claim)

These are `NO_COVERAGE`: no test executes the line, so nothing has been
observed about the mutant's behaviour and calling it "equivalent" would be a
claim we have not earned. They are accepted because the convention says not to
test this shape, which is a coverage decision — a different thing.

**Wall-clock delegates** (`epoch`) — *closed 2026-07-23: all eight rows
killed.* The group used to be accepted as a coverage decision ("testing the
delegates would pin the system clock"), but that conflated two things: the
arithmetic, which the explicit-`now` overloads pin exactly, and *delegation* —
that the no-arg forms feed a real reading into that arithmetic — which nothing
asserted at all. `wallClockDelegatesFeedTheExplicitNowArithmetic` now asserts
delegation with bounds that are not timing tolerances: the epoch under test
ends around the year 29,300, so "remaining is positive", "the slot estimate is
at least the sampled index", and "the height is at least the sampled height"
hold for any clock reading this millennium, deterministically. If a delegate
ever stops delegating (drops a term, calls the wrong overload, returns a
constant), these fail; nothing here can flap short of a machine whose clock
predates the sample origin.

## Not deterministically reachable (accepted, but not "equivalent")

Kept separate on purpose: these mutants *do* change observable behaviour. They
are accepted because the ratchet requires deterministic kills, not because they
are inert. Each would need a genuinely concurrent observer (core's
concurrency block is now fully banked — see
`../../ravina-core/config/pitest/README.md` for the latch and seam
techniques), a controllable clock, or a live socket — and the alternative, a
sleep- or tolerance-based test, flaps the ratchet, which is strictly worse
than recorded debt.

Note this is now a *small* residue. The "deliberately unmigrated, I/O-driven"
note in `AGENTS.md` turned out to describe difficulty rather than
impossibility: `LookupTableCacheMap` (97 of 103), the tx monitor family (148 of
168) and `TransactionProcessorRecord` (69 of 69) all yielded to in-memory
fakes — a `java.lang.reflect.Proxy`-backed `SolanaRpcClient`, a scripted
websocket, and running the loops synchronously on the test thread. Only the two
classes below retain real debt.

**`EpochInfoServiceImpl` (17)** — still the largest single block. The
*log-text-only* group that used to dominate it is gone: `logEpoch` both
formatted a message and logged it, and returned its own argument, so eleven
branch-selection and arithmetic mutants were unkillable purely because their
only consumer was a string. Extracting a pure `epochLogMessage(previous,
latest, now)` and moving the `logger.log` to the call sites killed all twelve.
See "A cluster on logging is a design signal" in `../../HARDENING.md`.

What remains, verified by hand-applying each mutant:
- *The concurrency-blocked debt is gone* (2026-07-23, in two waves — see the
  concurrency-harness section in `../../ravina-core/config/pitest/README.md`
  for the techniques). The parked-waiter handshake test
  (`initializationReleasesAParkedAwaiterWithThePublishedEpoch`) killed the
  `awaitInitialized` slow path, its lock/unlock removals and `run`'s
  `initializedCondition.signalAll()`. The signal-while-parked test
  (`fetchEpochNowWakesTheParkedLoopAndPacesTheRefetchByOneSlot`) then killed
  what "`fetchEpochNow == true` is not deterministically producible" used to
  excuse: `fetchEpochNow()`'s `signal()`, the pacing gate and its entire
  once-unreachable block (the one-slot sleep math, its `> 0` boundary and
  ORDER mutants, the `clock.sleep`), the mean-per-slot selection at
  initialization (now observable through the pacing sleep), and the
  samples-operand of the fetch disjunction. One handshake row remains:
  `awaitInitialized`'s fast-path `EQUAL_ELSE` (`# slow-path-equivalent`) —
  forcing the slow path when already initialized takes the lock, sees
  `initialized` true and returns the same epoch, a genuine equivalent.
- *Only observable as a longer or shorter `await`* (`# await-pacing-only`):
  the pacing `sleep` feeds only `await(Math.max(mean, sleep))`, and `await`
  is deliberately not clock-routed because it is signallable.
- *The fetch-disjunction remnants at line 236*: forcing an operand true
  (`# fetch-disjunction-converging`) is indistinguishable when every wake
  fetches anyway, and the `now > endsAt` ORDER/boundary forms
  (`# idle-spin-only`) are evaluated only when the prior terms are false,
  where nothing advances the clock.
- *Logging removals* on the relocated `logger.log` call sites and the exit
  message — the documented equivalent family.

Several rows are `# note`-marked duplicates from 2026-07-23: the 21.5.10
plugin's multiset comparison materialized sibling mutants the old set-based
compare collapsed — compound conditions and multi-op expressions emit one
mutant per operand at a single `class,method,line,mutator` coordinate. Each
sibling was accepted into the family above that already covers its line (the
`sleep` expression feeding only `await`, the fetch disjunction, the
`getAndSetEpochInfo` stats-recompute guard — `# stats-recompute-guard`,
forcing the `slotStats == null && samplesFuture != null` conjuncts recomputes
the stats from the same completed samples future, which joins to the same
samples and so the same stats); no new behaviour class was introduced. Two of the
six originally materialized here — the pacing-block subtraction and the
fetch disjunction's samples operand — have since been *killed* by the
signal-while-parked harness. Same event, one row:
`WebSocketManagerImpl.checkConnection` line 106 in `catchAll`, the sibling
operand of the outer double-checked condition.

**`WebSocketManagerImpl` (8)** — was 12: the 2026-07-21 `NanoClock`
migration killed the two `elapsed == connectionDelay` millisecond boundaries
(now exact strict-inequality tests on an injected clock), the
`webSocket == null` re-check, and — together with the retained-pending-connect
test — one of the `canConnect()` pair, whose blocking state ("requires real
time to pass") a test clock now reaches deterministically. The same migration
killed the staleness boundary in `LookupTableCacheMap.refreshStaleAccounts`
and the resend-delay boundary in `TxCommitmentMonitorService` — five rows
total, none replaced. What remains here: double-checked-locking re-reads
whose condition is already true when re-evaluated (`# dcl-recheck`),
`resetWebsocket`'s return value that only reaches log text
(`# log-text-only`), and logging removals.

**Wall-clock websocket confirmation fallback** `# ws-timeout-fallback` (`catchAll`) —
`TxCommitmentMonitorService.tryAwaitCommitmentViaWebSocket` lines 239/240
(`NakedReceiverMutator` on `.orTimeout(...)` / `.exceptionally(...)`) and the
`NO_COVERAGE` `VoidMethodCallMutator` at line 241 inside that fallback lambda.
`CompletableFuture.orTimeout` schedules on the JVM-global delayed executor,
which is real time and cannot be routed through `NanoClock`, so firing the
timeout deterministically is impossible in-harness — the fallback lambda never
runs (hence the no-coverage row: unreachable here, not "equivalent"), and
dropping the stages is only observable by waiting out the timeout. The RPC
polling path covers the eventual outcome; the websocket fallback's own timing
is the recorded debt.

**Response-tracker wiring needs a live response** `# needs-live-response` (`catchAll`) —
`LoadBalanceUtil.createRPCLoadBalancer` line 19, `NakedReceiverMutator` on
`.testResponse(capacityMonitor.errorTracker())`. The predicate is consulted
only when an HTTP response arrives, and `SolanaRpcClient` exposes no accessor
for it, so building the balancer offline cannot distinguish the drop. The
`endpoint` and `httpClient` wiring on the neighbouring lines *are* asserted
through the client's accessors.

**Loop-unbounding mutants detected only by timeout** (`catchAll`, a handful in
`LookupTableCacheMap` and `BaseTxMonitorService.run`) — see the note in
`../../ravina-core/config/pitest/README.md`: PIT's timeout detection is
load-dependent here, so these sit in the baseline rather than being trusted as
reliably detected. Where a fake could convert a timeout into a deterministic
failure it was preferred — `BaseInstructionServiceTests` gives its fake
processor a call budget of 32 precisely so eight would-be timeouts fail an
assertion instead.

## `EpochInfoServiceImpl` was migrated to `NanoClock`

It previously read the wall clock directly, which made a block of its mutants
unreachable and made the baseline itself unstable — over six consecutive runs
the unkilled count moved between 106 and 107, with `logEpoch` line 151 flipping
between `NO_COVERAGE` and `SURVIVED`.

It now takes a `NanoClock`: all seven `currentTimeMillis()` reads, the loop's
pacing sleep, and the retry backoff (`SECONDS.sleep`, which is easy to miss
when grepping for `Thread.sleep`) go through it. Results, measured:

- The suite runs in **0.095s, down from 2.055s** — the two retry tests were
  real one-second waits. Because PIT re-runs the suite per mutant, that took
  `pitestCatchAll` from ~80s to ~21s.
- Retry pacing is now assertable: `repeatedFailuresEscalateTheRetryDelayAlongTheFibonacciSequence`
  pins the escalation against the delays the service's own backoff produces,
  killing the error-count mutants that were previously "observable only as a
  longer or shorter sleep".
- Run-to-run variance is **gone**. The last of it was not the clock at all: the
  performance-sample fetch went through `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` on a
  virtual-thread executor, and the service does not always join that future, so
  the recorded call counts were a race the tests usually won. The harness now
  uses an inline executor. Three consecutive runs produce an identical unkilled
  set, where before the count moved between 106 and 107 with statuses flipping.

The migration by itself killed nothing — it made the class *testable*, and the
tests written against the injected clock then took the block from 45 to 40 and
found a latent NPE (below). What is left is genuinely blocked on threading, not
on the clock. `Condition.await` is
deliberately **not** routed through the clock — it is signallable, so a clock
cannot stand in for it, and the handshake mutants that need a second thread
parked in `awaitInitialized` remain out of reach.

When hand-editing a baseline, normalise the mutator name the way the verify
task does — strip the `org.pitest.mutationtest.engine.gregor.mutators.` package
**and** the `returns.` sub-package. A row spelled `returns.NullReturnValsMutator`
sits in the file but never matches, so the entry is reported as new forever.
Prefer `-PupdateMutationBaseline`, which writes the canonical form.
